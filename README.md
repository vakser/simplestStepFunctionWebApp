Assignment solution for GFL course "Java Basic+"
WARNING! There is a persistent issue (Error 404) with a function calculation when the project is started for the first time or redeployed, possibly due to some problem with MathJax library processing (have never used it before). Microsoft Edge seems to be the least prone. Working on solution, but any help in this matter will be highly appreciated.
